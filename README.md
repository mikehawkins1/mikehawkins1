# Mike Hawkins

Systems & Reliability Engineer working at the intersection of infrastructure automation and real-world physical systems.

I design, build, automate, and troubleshoot complex systems that span software, electrical, and mechanical domains.

## What I Work On

### Infrastructure & Reliability
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
- AWS systems engineering & automation
- CI/CD pipelines & operational tooling
- Linux systems & database platforms (PostgreSQL, Oracle)
- Observability, telemetry, and incident response design
- Failure analysis & operational resilience

### Applied Systems & Mechatronics
- CAD modeling (Fusion 360)
- 3D printer architecture & firmware (Klipper-based systems)
- Motion systems & CNC design principles
- Embedded system diagnostics
- CAN bus (J1939) familiarity
- Electrical power distribution & signal troubleshooting
- Mechanical & hydraulic system integration

## Systems Philosophy

I approach engineering holistically.

Systems fail at the boundaries — between hardware and software, power and logic, control and execution. My work focuses on understanding those boundaries and designing with failure modes in mind.

I am particularly interested in:

- Infrastructure reliability engineering
- Critical power & industrial environments
- Automation grounded in physical constraints
- Systems where digital control interfaces with mechanical reality

Building systems that integrate cleanly, fail predictably, and scale responsibly.
