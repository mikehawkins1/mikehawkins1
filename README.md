# Mike Hawkins

Systems & Reliability Engineer focused on infrastructure automation and cross-domain systems integration.

I design, build, automate, and troubleshoot complex systems that span software, electrical, and mechanical domains.

## Core Focus Areas

- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
- AWS systems engineering & automation
- Reliability engineering & failure analysis
- Observability & telemetry design
- Automation tooling (Python / Go)
- Mechanical + electrical system diagnostics
- Physical + digital systems integration

---

## Systems Engineering Across Layers

My work spans both digital infrastructure and physical systems.

### Infrastructure & Automation
- Cloud architecture & deployment (AWS)
- CI/CD & operational automation
- Linux systems & database platforms (PostgreSQL, Oracle)
- Monitoring & incident response design
- Reliability & redundancy planning

### Applied Mechatronics & Physical Systems
- CAD modeling (Fusion 360)
- 3D printer modification & firmware (Klipper-based systems)
- CNC & motion system design concepts
- Embedded diagnostics & hardware troubleshooting
- CAN bus (J1939) familiarity
- Electrical power & signal integrity troubleshooting
- Hydraulic & mechanical systems integration

## Engineering Approach

I think in terms of:

- Failure modes across layers
- Signal flow (electrical, logical, mechanical)
- System coupling & integration risk
- Power, control, and data boundaries
- Automation opportunities grounded in physical reality

I am particularly interested in roles involving infrastructure reliability, industrial systems, critical power environments, and automation where physical and digital layers intersect.
